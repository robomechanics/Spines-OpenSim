**Basic Mechanical Advantage:** To get force based mechanical advantage graph, use the MA_Forces.py script with an OpenSim Model

**Mechanical Advantage with parasitic forces in mind:** The Parasitic_Forces_MA.py script allows a comparision of mechanical advantage with MA with parasitic forces taken into account. The MA at peak efficiency is the same but the rest of the graph differs as efficiency goes down.
